# Arduino Automatic Plant Watering System


## Introduction

During the depths of March Rona quarantine, I decided to make an automatic plant watering system with the Arduino board I had from college. 
While it took a little while to figure out, the system now monitors the soil moisture level, records the measurements to an SD card, and waters the plant according
to a simple model I created. After tuning the model, I am now able to maintain the soil moisture level within a much narrower band than before.
